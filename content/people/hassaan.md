biography = "Hassaan received his BSc from the University of Waterloo in Biomedical Science, and a Master of Bioinformatics from the University of Guelph. For his Master's, he worked at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research with Dr. JÃ¼ri Reimand on the study of enhancers and long non-coding RNAs and their interactions with promoter regions in tumor-tissue. Subsequently, he joined the labs of Dr. Bo Wang and Dr. Kieran Campbell for his PhD in the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto, where his research involves the development and application of machine learning and computational biology methods in single-cell genomics, particularly on integrating disparate and multi-modal single-cell datasets."
